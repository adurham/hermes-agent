"""Guard against degenerate consult answers (leaked markup / request echo).

Regression for 2026-07-09: a local aux model answered a consult with the
consult request itself wrapped in raw DSML tool-call markup; the main agent
then presented a fabricated "reference model's take" to the user. The tool
must classify such answers as unavailable, never as a usable answer.
