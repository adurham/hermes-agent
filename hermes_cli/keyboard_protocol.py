"""Kitty keyboard protocol — enable enhanced key reporting at startup.

This makes terminals that support the protocol (kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty, foot,
Alacritty 0.13+, iTerm2 3.5+) send unique CSI-u sequences for keys that
otherwise overlap with their unmodified counterparts. The headline win for
Hermes is **Shift+Enter** — without this, terminals send `\\r` for both Enter
and Shift+Enter, so apps can't tell them apart.

We push the enhanced mode at startup and pop it on exit (plus atexit, plus
SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers) so the user's terminal isn't left in enhanced mode
if Hermes crashes. Terminals that don't speak the protocol silently ignore
the escape sequences — no regression, just no Shift+Enter.

Spec: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/

Sequences:
    \\x1b[>1u   push enhanced mode (flag 1 = "disambiguate escape codes",
                which is the minimum needed to get CSI-u for Enter+modifiers)
    \\x1b[<u    pop one level off the mode stack

We use the push/pop variant rather than the set/reset variant so that nested
TUIs (vim, less) launched from inside Hermes can push their own modes without
losing ours when they exit.
