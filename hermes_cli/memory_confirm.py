"""CLI confirm UI for Phase 2 auto-memory proposals.

Called from cli.py's exit handler (before shutdown_memory_provider).
Shows the user a list of proposed memory entries, asks which to accept
edit / reject, and commits accepted ones via the conflict-resolution
pipeline.

Design:
  * BLOCKS the exit by ~1-2 LLM calls + user input. That's intentional —
    the user is exiting; they have a moment to review.
  * Single Q-press to accept all, single d-press to discard all, batch
    mode for power users.
  * Edit support: pick an entry by letter, get prompt-toolkit input
    pre-populated with the proposal, edit and re-submit.
  * Each entry shows the conflict verdict (NEW / DUPLICATE / REFINEMENT
    / CONTRADICTION) before the user decides. Contradictions surface
    BOTH the new and existing fact text.

The UI is plain-print + input(). prompt_toolkit niceties are nice but
this runs on session exit when the prompt_toolkit session may already
be torn down.

    Each proposal is enriched with a conflict verdict before the user
    sees it so they can make informed decisions on REFINEMENT /
    CONTRADICTION cases.

    Display rules:
      - When N <= 3, content is shown in full (wrapped to terminal width)
        rather than truncated, since the user can easily read all of it.
      - When N >= 4, content is shortened to fit one line; the user can
        run ``show <letter>`` to expand a single entry.
      - Each entry shows its tier+target (warm-tier categories or hot
        tier targets like ``hot:user`` / ``hot:memory``) so accept-all
        doesn't quietly bloat the always-loaded prompt budget.
      - Existing entries with semantic overlap (REFINEMENT / DUPLICATE /
        CONTRADICTION) display the matched fact text inline so the user
        can spot near-duplicate accretion before approving.

    Auto-accept countdown:
      - After rendering the proposals, a 3-second "press any key to
        review" countdown runs. If the user presses anything, control
        falls through to the interactive prompt as before. If the timer
        expires, all proposals are auto-accepted. This is the fast path
        for the common case where the user is just exiting and the
        proposals look fine; the explicit prompt remains available for
        edits / rejects / partial accepts.
      - Non-tty stdin (gateway, cron, CI) skips the countdown and
        auto-accepts immediately — no human watching means no point
