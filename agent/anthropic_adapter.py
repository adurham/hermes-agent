"""Anthropic Messages API adapter for Hermes Agent.

Translates between Hermes's internal OpenAI-style message format and
Anthropic's Messages API. Follows the same pattern as the codex_responses
adapter — all provider-specific logic is isolated here.

Targets ``client.beta.messages.{create,stream}`` (anthropic SDK 0.100+).
The beta namespace exposes typed kwargs for the beta-gated fields
``thinking``, ``output_config``, ``context_management``, ``betas``,
``speed``, and ``metadata`` — eliminating the ``extra_body`` /
``extra_headers`` workarounds the plain ``messages.*`` namespace required.

Wire shape mirrors Claude Code 2.1.119 (verified by mitmdump capture
2026-05-06): same betas, same body field set, same metadata.user_id
identity blob shape.

Auth supports:
  - Regular API keys (sk-ant-api*) → x-api-key header
  - OAuth setup-tokens (sk-ant-oat*) → Bearer auth + beta header
  - Claude Code credentials (~/.claude.json or ~/.claude/.credentials.json) → Bearer auth

# ``anthropic/_streaming.py:102`` (``if sse.event == "ping": continue``),
# so during a request's queue + prefill phase the iterator yields nothing
# even though the server is sending keep-alive pings every ~10 s.  The
# downstream stale-stream detector in ``run_agent.py`` cannot distinguish
# "queued upstream, healthy" from "connection black-holed" without ping
# visibility, and ends up killing healthy long-TTFT requests (e.g.
# Opus 4.7 + 1M-context with a 200 K-token prompt on the OAuth/subscription
# path, where TTFT routinely exceeds 5 minutes).
#
# Hook design: monkey-patch ``Stream._iter_events`` — the source iterator
# that yields *all* SSE events including pings — to fire a thread-local
# callback before passing each event through.  The SDK's filtering layer
# (``Stream.__stream__``) still drops pings as before, so consumers see
# unchanged behavior.  Patches are installed once per process, guarded
# against SDK-internal API changes; on failure we log a warning and leave
# the SDK untouched (the cold-start tolerance in run_agent.py remains as
# a backstop).

# Claude 4.6 replaced budget-based extended thinking with *adaptive* thinking,

# claude-fable-5) follow the same modern contract — but they share no common
# version substring, so an allowlist of version numbers ("4.6", "4.7", …) goes
# stale the moment a model ships without a recognized number and silently
# routes it down the legacy manual-thinking path.
#
# Instead we DEFAULT unknown Claude models to the modern contract and keep an
# explicit *legacy* list of the older Claude families that still require manual
# thinking.  This mirrors _get_anthropic_max_output's "default to newest" design
# (future models are unlikely to regress to the older contract), so each new
# Claude release works without a code change.
#
# Non-Claude Anthropic-Messages models (minimax, qwen3, GLM, …) are NOT Claude,
# so they fall through to the legacy path automatically — exactly what those

    """Create an Anthropic client, auto-detecting setup-tokens vs API keys.

    ``api_key`` accepts either:

    * a static ``str`` — the historical contract for all key-based and
      OAuth flows.
    * a ``Callable[[], str]`` — an Entra ID bearer token provider from
      :mod:`agent.azure_identity_adapter`. The Anthropic SDK itself
      requires a static string, so when given a callable we construct
      a custom ``httpx.Client`` with a request event hook that mints a
      fresh JWT per outbound request and rewrites the ``Authorization``
      header. The SDK never sees the callable directly.

    If *timeout* is provided it overrides the default 900s read timeout.  The
    connect timeout stays at 10s.  Callers pass this from the per-provider /
    per-model ``request_timeout_seconds`` config so Anthropic-native and
    Anthropic-compatible providers respect the same knob as OpenAI-wire
    providers.

    ``drop_context_1m_beta=True`` strips ``context-1m-2025-08-07`` from the
    client-level ``anthropic-beta`` header. Used by the reactive OAuth retry
    path in ``run_agent.py`` when a subscription rejects the beta; leave at
    its default on fresh clients so 1M-capable subscriptions keep the
    capability.

    ``model`` (when provided) lets ``_common_betas_for_base_url`` strip the
    1M-context beta proactively for models that don't have a 1M tier (e.g.
    Haiku 4.5). Without this, the auxiliary client gets ``context-1m-…``
    on its client-level headers and Haiku rejects every call with HTTP 400
    "long context beta is not yet available for this subscription". The
    main agent loop sets ``drop_context_1m_beta`` explicitly, so leaving
    ``model`` at None there is fine.

    Returns an anthropic.Anthropic instance.

    """Drop tool_use / tool_result blocks for tools not in the live tool list.

    Anthropic's Messages API rejects any request whose history contains a
    ``tool_use`` block whose ``name`` is not present in the current
    ``tools`` array — the error surfaces as
    ``invalid_request_error: Tool reference 'X' not found in available tools``.

    This is easy to hit in practice:

      * MCP server reconnect storms — when ``mcp__salesforce__*`` /
        ``hermes_swarm_*`` / ``StackOverflowTeams_*`` tools were used
        last turn but the MCP server fails to reconnect this turn,
        their schemas are absent from the tool list while the prior
        ``tool_use`` blocks remain in the conversation transcript.
      * Toolset switches mid-session via ``/toolsets remove`` — drops
        ``clarify`` / ``send_message`` etc. while the assistant message
        history still carries calls to them.
      * Subagents / batched delegates — the parent's history contains
        tool calls that the leaf subagent's narrower toolset doesn't
        expose.

    We replace each unknown ``tool_use`` (and its matching ``tool_result``)
    with a small text block describing what was called.  Pure removal would
    be safer wire-shape-wise but lossier: the model loses the breadcrumb
    that a tool ran.  Text replacement preserves the trail while satisfying
    Anthropic's validator.

    Empty / None ``available_tool_names`` is treated as "drop everything"
    — the orphan-stripping in ``convert_messages_to_anthropic`` already
    handles the no-tools-at-all case for unmatched pairs, but a matched
    pair with a stale name still slips through; this catches it.

    Anthropic delivers a ``tool_search_tool_<variant>_tool_result`` block
    in a *later* assistant turn than the one that emitted the matching
    ``server_tool_use(id=X)``. The request-build relocation
    (``_relocate_orphaned_tool_search_results``) fixes this on outbound,
    but the on-disk session JSON keeps the split. If compaction
    summarises one of the two messages and the API call rebuilds, you
    get a 400:
      ``tool_search_tool_<variant> tool use with id ... was found
      without a corresponding tool_search_tool_<variant>_tool_result``.

    Calling this at persistence time co-locates the pair on disk so
    compaction can never split them — the compactor's existing
    ``_align_boundary_*`` logic treats the merged message as a single
    unit, and ``_sanitize_tool_pairs`` doesn't need any awareness of
    server-side block types.

    """Reorder assistant content so client ``tool_use`` blocks come AFTER
    any server-side blocks (``server_tool_use`` / ``*_tool_result``) within
    the same message.

    Why this exists:

    Anthropic's input validator requires that the next user message's
    ``tool_result`` for a client ``tool_use`` be "immediately after" it
    in the message list — and "immediately after" means the very next
    message, with no intervening server-side blocks pushing the
    client tool_use earlier in its own content array. When the model
    emits a client tool_use BEFORE deciding to invoke server-side
    tool_search, the captured response carries the order
    ``[tool_use, server_tool_use, *_tool_result]``. Replaying that
    verbatim trips the validator with HTTP 400:

      "messages.N: ``tool_use`` ids were found without ``tool_result``
       blocks immediately after: <client tool_use id>"

    Even though the client tool_use IS followed (in the next message)
    by its tool_result. The validator considers the trailing
    server-side blocks an obstruction.

    Fix: move all client ``tool_use`` blocks to the end of their
    assistant message, preserving the relative order of server-side
    blocks, thinking blocks, and text. The client tool_use blocks
    themselves keep their relative order among each other.

    Thinking-signature safety:

    Anthropic signs thinking blocks against their position in the
    response. ``context_management.clear_thinking_20251015`` enforces
    that each block stays in place across turns. Moving a client
    ``tool_use`` past server-side blocks doesn't relocate any thinking
    block — they stay where the model emitted them. We only refuse to
    reorder when a thinking block sits BETWEEN a client tool_use and
    a trailing server-side block (because moving the tool_use past
    the thinking would change the content stream the thinking signed
    against). Those messages pass through unchanged and may still
    400; loudly logging so we can diagnose if we ever see one.

    Mutates ``messages`` in place. Idempotent — once the client
    tool_use is at the end, repeated passes are no-ops.

    """Rewrite variant-suffixed ``tool_search_tool_<variant>_tool_result``
    block types to the bare canonical form ``tool_search_tool_result``.

    Why this exists:

    Anthropic's wire payload delivers tool-search result blocks with a
    variant-suffixed type (e.g. ``tool_search_tool_regex_tool_result``)
    that mirrors the paired ``server_tool_use.name``
    (``tool_search_tool_regex``). The Python SDK's
    ``BetaToolSearchToolResultBlock`` model declares
    ``type: Literal["tool_search_tool_result"]`` — the bare canonical
    form — and Pydantic silently coerces the wire value to that literal
    when parsing.

    Empirically (verified live against api.anthropic.com on 2026-05-07,
    request_id ``req_011Cap2RUgsJp1CVsGAR6LTa``), Anthropic's INPUT
    validator's accept list contains ``tool_search_tool_result`` —
    the bare canonical — and rejects any variant-suffixed form with:

      "Input tag '<variant>_tool_result' found using 'type' does not
       match any of the expected tags: ..., 'tool_search_tool_result',
       'tool_use', ..."

    A prior workaround in this file (``_normalize_tool_search_result_for_input``,
    docstring still in place for historical reference but its behavior
    is fixed here) claimed the opposite — that the variant suffix was
    REQUIRED and that re-emitting the canonical bare form failed the
    pairing check. That claim was either out of date or misdiagnosed;
    the validator's own error message today is unambiguous about which
    tag is accepted.

    So: any block whose type starts with ``tool_search_tool_`` and ends
    with ``_tool_result`` gets its type collapsed to the bare canonical
    form. Mutates ``content`` in place. Idempotent — the bare canonical
    is its own fixed point.

    Accepts either a single content array (``List[Dict]``) or a full
    message list (``List[Dict]`` where each dict has ``role``/
    ``content``); the latter case dispatches per-message.
    """

        Stubs carry ``defer_loading: True``, the Anthropic
        ``tool_search_tool_<variant>_20251119`` server tool is prepended to
        the array, and the model discovers tools via that server tool.
        Anthropic re-bills the FULL prompt context for each server-tool
        iteration within an API call.  See agent.log forensics from the
        2026-05-13 case 00271597 session for 2x/3x/4x prompt-token
        multiplier evidence.

    ``"client_side"``
        Stubs are regular tools (no ``defer_loading`` flag), no server tool
        is prepended, and the model discovers tools via the client-side
        ``hermes_load_tools`` tool registered in ``tools/hermes_load_tools.py``

        load step is a normal client-side round-trip — billed once per
        call, no multiplier.  Names in ``promoted_tools`` skip the stub
        and ship their full schema.

    Deferral policy (additive, evaluated in order, identical across modes):
      1. ``additional_deferred`` — exact tool names always deferred.
      2. ``additional_eager`` — exact tool names always eager (overrides 1).
      3. ``defer_mcp_tools`` — when True, any tool whose name starts with
         a known MCP server prefix is deferred.  Server prefixes are
         passed via ``tool_search_config["mcp_server_prefixes"]``.

    Naming note — two distinct concepts, easily confused:
      max_tokens     = OUTPUT token cap for a single response.
                       Anthropic's API calls this "max_tokens" but it only
                       limits the *output*.  Anthropic's own native SDK
                       renamed it "max_output_tokens" for clarity.
      context_length = TOTAL context window (input tokens + output tokens).
                       The API enforces: input_tokens + max_tokens ≤ context_length.
                       Stored on the ContextCompressor; reduced on overflow errors.

    When *max_tokens* is None the model's native output ceiling is used
    (e.g. 128K for Opus 4.6, 64K for Sonnet 4.6).

    When *context_length* is provided and the model's native output ceiling
    exceeds it (e.g. a local endpoint with an 8K window), the output cap is
    clamped to context_length − 1.  This only kicks in for unusually small
    context windows; for full-size models the native output cap is always
    smaller than the context window so no clamping happens.
    NOTE: this clamping does not account for prompt size — if the prompt is
    large, Anthropic may still reject the request.  The caller must detect
    "max_tokens too large given prompt" errors and retry with a smaller cap
    (see parse_available_output_tokens_from_error + _ephemeral_max_output_tokens).

    When *is_oauth* is True, applies Claude Code compatibility transforms:
    system prompt prefix, tool name prefixing, and prompt sanitization.

    When *preserve_dots* is True, model name dots are not converted to hyphens
    (for Alibaba/DashScope anthropic-compatible endpoints: qwen3.5-plus).

    When *base_url* points to a third-party Anthropic-compatible endpoint,
    thinking block signatures are stripped (they are Anthropic-proprietary).

    When *fast_mode* is True, sets typed ``speed="fast"`` and adds the
    fast-mode beta to the per-request ``betas`` list for ~2.5x faster output
    throughput on Opus 4.6. Native Anthropic only — third-party gateways
    don't recognize the speed parameter.

    Output kwargs assume ``client.beta.messages.{create,stream}``: typed
    fields ``thinking``, ``output_config``, ``context_management``, ``betas``,
    ``speed``, ``metadata`` all land on the wire as top-level body fields.

        #    mcp__-prefixed, or the CC-canonical surface (and the billing
        #    mimicry) breaks. So we skip CC-aliased builtins + CC-canonical
